* Currently not calling tearDownEvents() always for plugins to remove breakpoints, 
  etc.

  	* maybe create an unload plugins command which removes all currently set events for that plugin ....

  * Add support for all VM events (currently only four most used types supported)

* No support for multiple handlers for a single event

* Make sure everything is platform independent and configurable

* Add documentation!!

* Add licensing info and thirdparty libs documentation

* Fix all the bugs :)
